##

I'm a developer based in the Philippines.

My main interests in Software Engineering are:

- Memory Management
- API Development
- Full Stack Development

I love learning and ~~coffee~~ personal development experiences.

My current favorite project of mine is [Filtered Feels](https://github.com/ToshoBread/Filtered-Feels.git)
which is a freedom wall web app I built using **Bootstrap** and **PHP**.

My current main hobby is **Cybersecurity**, specializing in **Forensics** and **Reverse Engineering**.\
I like playing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, they feel as if I'm solving escape rooms.

Other hobbies include:

- Game Development
- Anime
- Nature Photography

###### I use neovim btw.
