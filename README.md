##

I'm a software developer based in the Philippines.

My main interests in Software Engineering are:

- Micro-optimization
- API Development
- Full Stack Development

I love learning and ~~coffee~~ personal development experiences.

My favorite project of mine is [Filtered Feels](https://github.com/ToshoBread/Filtered-Feels.git)
which is a freedom wall web app I built using **Bootstrap** and **PHP**.

Currently, my main hobby is programming in **Bash**, writing custom
scripts to enhance my workflow, such as a **django-admin** wrapper
with extended functionality tailored to my conventions.

Other hobbies include:

- Game Development
- Cybersecurity (Specializing in **Forensics** and **RE**)
- Anime
- Nature Photography

###### I use neovim btw.
